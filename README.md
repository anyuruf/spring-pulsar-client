This project implements the Java LookupData produce implement in Java from https://rockthejvm.com/articles/stateful-streams-with-apache-pulsar-and-apache-flink/ I used the latest springboot 3.4.0 and Apache Pulsar 4.0. The data is in the resources folder and using the same data. Using the springboot Resource loader and Apache common-csv to read the files from the folder (Check the CsvService class) and the springboot pulsar client to produce data to pulsar.
